CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
=====================

  The challenge directory contains four files: two are raw text files "key" and "pass", the
  instructions in "instructions.txt" and the encrypted solution file in "solution.txt.enc".
  The instructions suggest we need to solve a puzzle from a book.


INFORMATION GATHERING
=====================

  Both the files "key" and "pass" contain cipher text. The file "pass" only contains the
  encrypted string:
   "MQ1O27IM3E3EIML23KQ4EIQILSLKI526L3KAL61Q6IJ63ZMI257KAL652IML56AL652IMLEXQ6O"
  The file "key" contains a single line with 100118 characters of cipher text. The cipher text is
  made up of the following 27 symbols:
    '/', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8',
    'A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'S', 'W', 'X', 'Z'
  The symbol '/' occurs repeatedly, in long sequences.


SOLUTION
========

  Decrypting the "key" file
  -------------------------
   As the symbol '/' seems to appear without any pattern, we will ignore it when analysing
   the cipher text. This leaves 26 cipher characters, which corroborates the possibility that
   the original text could have been encrypted with a substitution cipher, or a transposition
   cipher. By performing character frequency analysis, the most frequently occurring characters
   are found. The top ten most frequently occurring characters, along with their number of
   occurrences and frequencies are shown below:
    L: 8417  11.933%
    I: 6216   8.813%
    Q: 5786   8.203%
    5: 5348   7.582%
    M: 4816   6.828%
    K: 4617   6.546%
    3: 4454   6.315%
    E: 3873   5.491%
    4: 3708   5.257%
    6: 3531   5.006%
   When treating one or more '/' characters in the cipher text as whitespace, we can perform word
   frequency analysis as well. The top five most frequently occurring words, along with their
   number of occurrences and frequencies are given below:
    IML : 0962  5.437%
    QKA : 0762  4.307%
    Q   : 0655  3.702%
    I5  : 0355  2.006%
    3   : 0256  1.447%
   We know the two most used letters in English are 'e' and 't' [1]. Furthermore, we know the most
   used word in English is the word "the" [2]. Both the fact that "IML" is the most frequently
   occurring word in the cipher text and that 'L' and 'I' are the most frequently occurring
   characters in the cipher text, support that 'I' maps to 't' and 'L' maps to 'e', so that "IML"
   maps to "the". It is therefore reasonable to assume the original text has been encrypted with
   a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

   The rest of the "key" file can be decrypted by iteratively making more guesses regarding
   the mapping from cipher text characters to plain text letters and analysing the plain text
   words that start to form.



  Decrypting the "pass" file
  --------------------------
  The decrypted "key" file does not seem to contain any significant information. It is merely
  a hotchpotch of nursery rhymes. However, the same substitution key used to decrypt
  the "key" file, can also decrypt the "pass" file, yielding the solution to the challenge:
