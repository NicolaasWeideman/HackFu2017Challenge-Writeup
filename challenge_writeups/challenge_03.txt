CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
=====================

  The challenge directory contains three files: an audio file "test.wav", the instructions
  in "instructions.txt" and the encrypted solution file in "solution.txt.enc". The instructions
  suggest that we are searching for a message in an audio file playing the
  song "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star".


INFORMATION GATHERING
=====================

  The audio file seems to contain two overlaid melodies. The first melody is an adapted version
  of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". In the original version of the melody, every second bar is
  ended with a half note. In the adapted version, the half note is replaced with two quarter
  notes. The entire melody is therefore made up of quarter notes. We will refer to this melody as
  the "twinkle melody".

  The second melody, is unrecognisable. It consists of only short notes that do not seem to
  follow any pattern, except being aligned the twinkle melody. Using Audacity or Sonic Visualiser,
  the spectrogram of the music can be viewed. This does not yield useful any information
  immediately. The spectrogram however, does show that the short notes of the second melody are
  approximately one seventh the length of the quarter notes in the first melody. They are
  therefore twenty-eighth notes. We will refer to this melody as the "mystery melody".


SOLUTION
========

  As the twinkle melody is only a slight adaptation of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", it is
  reasonable to assume the solution to the challenge is rather hidden in the mystery melody.
  The length of the short notes in the mystery melody are significant, as twenty-eighth
  (or seventh) notes do not appear in standard musical theory [1]. After some trial and error,
  it was concluded that the seven possible twenty-eighth notes of the mystery melody for each
  quarter note of the twinkle melody, represents a 7-bit binary number. A twenty-eighth note, of
  any pitch, represents a 1, while a twenty-eighth rest represents a 0. The seven-bit number
  represents a 7-bit ASCII code. Decoding the notes in this manner yields the solution to the
  challenge:
    "hackfuandallyourtrickshellbearandneverseemtomind"
