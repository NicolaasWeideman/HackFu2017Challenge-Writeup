CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
=====================

  The challenge directory contains three files: a PDF file "Erno Rubik.pdf", the instructions
  in "instructions.txt" and the encrypted solution file in "solution.txt.enc". The instructions
  suggest that we are searching for a message hidden in a Rubik's Cube.


INFORMATION GATHERING
=====================

  The name of the PDF file, "Erno Rubik.pdf" is a reference to the inventor of the Rubik's Cube
  puzzle [1]. In this PDF file, an image of a cross, resembling an unfolded cube is shown.
  Each face of the cube consists of nine smaller squares, each shaded with a colour and containing
  a single symbol. The colours are blue, red, green, orange, yellow and white. The symbols are all
  either a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, an underscore or a circle. There are exactly nine
  squares with a specific colour and exactly one square with a specific symbol.
  
  Underneath the cube, a string of 225 characters appears. The string is made up of the
  symbols 'b', 'r', 'g', 'o', 'y', 'w', '1', '2' and '3'. The first 75 characters of the string
  consist of only letter symbols and the final 150 characters consist of only number symbols.
  We will refer to this string as the "cipher text".


SOLUTION
========

  Rearranging the Rubik's Cube
  ----------------------------
   From the information gathered, it is quite clear to see that the unfolded cube resembles an
   unsolved Rubik's Cube puzzle. The first important step in solving this challenge, is to note
   that it is unnecessary to solve the Rubik's Cube (in the conventional sense) to complete the
   challenge. As is the case with a physical Rubik's Cube, each square has exactly one correct
   final position. This correct final position can be determined for each square by inspecting
   it's constant neighbours, that is, squares on the same subcube, which will consequently be next
   to the square in every possible arrangement of subcubes. For example, suppose there is a red
   square with blue and white constant neighbours. This square will have to be the corner square
   of the red face, bordering the blue and white face. A similar strategy is followed for squares
   with only one constant neighbour. As middle squares cannot move they can be used to determine
   the final colour for a specific face of the cube. Therefore, as we know beforehand what the
   colour of each of the faces will ultimately be, we can simply place each square in its correct
   position. Figure 1 shows the final arrangement of symbols in the solved Rubik's Cube.

  Deciphering the Message
  -----------------------
   Looking at the symbols found in the cipher text, it is reasonable to assume the letters
   indicate colours. That is, 'o' stands for orange, 'b' for blue, 'w' for white, 'g' for green,
   'r' for red and 'y' for yellow. Note that there are exactly two number symbols in the cipher
   text for each letter symbol. Furthermore, the numbers the numbers are all between 1
   and 3 (inclusive). It seems as if each letter in the cipher text, together with two numbers
   map to a letter on the Rubik's Cube, with the numbers serving as a type of coordinate system
   and the letter indicating a specific face. To aide in the deciphering of the cipher text,
   rewrite it as follows: 

     brbgboorrooyoobgwrorwrgbwrwoworogoorwrrorwbobgorrooobrowyborobworyrrbwogoor
     313223323223123212231213321113222222113232223232322332212232213132312322223
     231131233222131132332313332322323331331231231123322231233223233113332323333

   Each column represents a single character in the plain text.
   To decipher the first character, we take of the blue face, the letter of the square on the 3rd
   row and 2nd column, which yields an 'H'. Similarly for the second character, we take of the red
   face, the letter of the square on the 1st row and 3rd column, which yields an 'a'. Proceeding
   in this manner, the solution to the challenge can be obtained:
