# HackFu2017Challenge-Writeup
This repository contains the write-ups for my solutions to challenges contained within the  HackFu 2017 Challenge.

Firstly, thank you to the people at [MWR Info Security](https://hackfu.mwrinfosecurity.com/) for their effort to create the challenges.
The challenges were difficult enough to keep one's interest, but not so difficult that one would abandon a challenge completely.

As the submission system, used for the Challenge, accepted solutions in plain text format, all my submissions are formatted only as plain text. I have, however, attempted to make them readable.

I have noticed that for many of the challenges there are more than one way to find the solution.
If you read my write-ups and you came up with a better solution, I would love to hear about it!
